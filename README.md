# üöÄ An Upcoming Feature-Rich, FOSS Cross-Platform IDE
### Get ready for a powerful new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that's free, open-source, and designed to work seamlessly across all your favorite devices. This IDE is being built from the ground up to offer a comprehensive and intuitive coding experience, no matter your operating system.

# üíª Cross-Platform by Design
### We're building for true cross-platform compatibility from day one, ensuring you have a consistent and high-quality experience whether you're coding on your desktop or on the go:

* Android
* Windows
* Linux
* macOS

# üõ†Ô∏è Built with Modern Technologies
### Our IDE leverages robust and widely-adopted technologies to deliver a fast, reliable, and extensible development environment:
* **CodeMirror 6**: Powering the core editor experience, CodeMirror 6 provides a highly performant and flexible text editor with advanced features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and more.
* **Capacitor**: For our mobile applications (Android and iOS), Capacitor bridges the gap between web technologies and native device capabilities, allowing us to deliver a truly native feel while leveraging our web-based codebase. We'll also be implementing native code for efficient zip compression and extraction directly on mobile devices.
* **Electron**: For desktop users (Windows, Linux, and macOS), Electron provides the native layer, enabling us to package our web application as a standalone desktop application with full access to system resources and a consistent user interface.

# What's Next?
This project is currently in its early stages of development. Stay tuned for updates on features, progress, and how you can get involved!
but I'll let ya in on a little *secret*..
